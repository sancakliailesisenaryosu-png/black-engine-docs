# Black Engine D’C.ntrlized (BED-C)
### *Securing the Temporal Blind Spot of Frontier AI*

## 🛡️ Executive Summary
Black Engine is a decentralized validation layer designed to prevent **Temporal Logic Bypass** and **State Hijacking** in AI agents. Current LLM architectures often treat temporal context as "intended behavior," leaving them vulnerable to critical logic exploits.

## 🚀 Research & Validation
Our core technology is based on high-impact security research identifying systemic logic gaps in frontier models.
* **Primary Case Study:** Google VRP Case #477783871 (Temporal Logic State Bypass).
* **Status:** Validation confirmed via engineering remediation patterns.

## 🔒 Stealth Mode Notice
This repository serves as the public-facing technical anchor for **Black Engine D’C.ntrlized**. 
Core proprietary protocols, including our **Decentralized Temporal Ledger**, are currently restricted to vetted partners and investors to protect the integrity of the security-remediation process.

## 📅 Roadmap
- **Q1 2026:** Alpha Launch (Private Beta)
- **Q1 2026:** Integration with MENA/Turkey AI Accelerator Program
